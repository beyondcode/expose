# Setup your authentication token

If you are using our managed Expose server infrastructure, you can obtain a free authentication token by [creating an account](https://expose.dev/register).

After logging in to Expose for the first time, you will see the installation steps for Expose, as well as your authentication token.
Copy the command to your clipboard to setup your authentication token.
